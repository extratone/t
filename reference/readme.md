# Telegram theming reference

my attempt to make a centralised key of theming properties in the various telegram apps. please feel free to message me with suggestions, or contribute

this used to be a gist, which would be better, but i've upgraded it to a real repo due to the limitations of gists

i've been doing this sporadically, which is why the formatting's a little messy. the telegram x sheet is the preferred formatting.

## contributing instructions

* fork this repo (top right of github's interface)
* make your changes
	* if you're not used to markdown, i recommend typora (actually i recommend it anyway)
		* if you must use notepad, use a monospace font with word wrap turned off
	* optionally, add your github to the rightmost column (copy the formatting from tdesktop.md)
* commit (& push)
* open a pull request

### useful miscellany:

* The section headers are ID'd with their own name, camel-case. To link to a section, make a link like so: `[Generic](#generic)`.
* Items prefixed with /?\ or /!\ are unknown - please message me if you discover their purpose
* Items postfixed with /?\ i am inferring their use, i'm not 100% sure
