# Circling Back to Tweetbot 6.3

![Harvest Theme - Tweetbot 6.3](https://i.snap.as/3Q0YFS3h.png)

## As the increasingly haphazard work of native Twitter software collapses around us, let us recognize yet again Tapbots‚Äô sure footing.

No, I can‚Äôt quite believe it, either, but I am investing *two whole*, precious items in this feed to a single application in the same calendar year.

# Circling Back to Tweetbot 6.3

![Harvest Theme - Tweetbot 6.3](https://i.snap.as/3Q0YFS3h.png)

Several weeks ago, after finally taking the taking the time to explore the modernizations shipped with TweetBot 6.2 [in mid-August](https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/17/tweetbot-6-2-update-timeline-widgets-multiple-windows-support-ipad), it occurred to me that it might be an ideal time to follow up on a brief exchange I‚Äôd had with Tapbots support in mid-February concerning a single, single key Bluetooth keyboard shortcut, ultimately - using the F key to favorite (and now `Shift + ‚åò + L` to ‚Äúlike‚Äù) which then seemed to have been lost in the transition from Tweetbot 5 to Tweetbot 6. If you‚Äôll recall from [my first stupidly time-consuming big Post of 2021](https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review), our conversation was left open ended with ‚Äúthanks, we‚Äôll take a look at these.‚Äù You might also recall a very specific pledge of mine which I just rediscovered:

> Without being verbose, I‚Äôll just tell you that if a near future update to the app fixes the `F` and `‚åò + R` shortcuts, I ùí≤‚Ñê‚Ñí‚Ñí shit out my whole ass.

The amount I‚Äôd learned about iPhone History and its operating system‚Äôs coinciding development in the since this exchange felt absolutely ginormous‚Ä¶ So frighteningly great was it to behold, that I actually included a lame suggestion in my reply, that it might have *something* to do with Objective C vs. SwiftUI (god y‚Äôall are so cliquey though,) in what I also decided would be the last time I bothered them about it.

Just *twenty-one* minutes later:

![Tapbots Reply](https://i.snap.as/r663eKgV.png)

Naturally‚Ä¶ They were 100% correct‚Ä¶ I just somehow managed to skip the crucial step of actually *trying the shortcuts in the app* before reaching out. Very likely the least competent behavior possible from *The iPhone Hardware Keyboard Guy*, yeah?

Anyway, though their spare release notes don‚Äôt mention it, the Tapbots guys obviously hooked a keyboard up to an iPhone recently. I‚Äôm actually not quite sure how many of these I missed before, but using the `R` key to Retweet, `Q` to Quote Tweet, and `L` to like have all been re-implemented. (You‚Äôll need to confirm Retweets with the `Return` key.)

## An alternative for those who refuse to pay for premium experiences but can no longer use ~~Tweetie~~ Twitter‚Äôs native option.

A few minutes ago, Twitter‚Äôs native iOS client inexplicably logged me out of the three accounts I‚Äôd signed in for the *second time today*, which for the first time prompted not anger, nor even frustration, truly, but a whole-body, calming, peaceful acceptance: **for me and my house, the time really has come to let com.atebits.Tweetie2 finally rest **.

#### Its last functions on my device 
1. Sharing the highest-quality image files possible.
2. Interacting with my account settings (checking up, exploring new beta features, etc.)
3. Hosting, popping-in, and testing Twitter Spaces.
4. Notifications.

For just these, the app occupied a woeful amount of file space compared to‚Ä¶ just about anything else (we‚Äôre talking [*by a factor of ten*](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1432312460095148034)) and at this point, literally too much of *my life* and emotional energy with its unendingly stupefying level of neglect. It hasn‚Äôt made sense for a long time.
