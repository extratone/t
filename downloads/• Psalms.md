- <mark>Along with saving deeplinks, Apple also built a system to rediscover links you previously saved via Quick Note and surface them again as you use apps. If you open an app that has a deeplink already saved in Notes, you’ll see a small Quick Note thumbnail pop in from the bottom right corner of the screen. That thumbnail indicates that you have an existing quick note containing a link to the page or app you’re currently viewing. Tap it, and the related quick note will appear, allowing you to resume editing it.</mark>

Holy heck, do I need this…

- <mark>Unfortunately, these voices do not include the new, more human Siri voices Apple rolled out earlier this year in iOS 14.5.</mark>

Actually, the 	`Make Spoken Audio From Text` action *does* now support Siri Voices 1-4! I’m not sure if this was an early beta limitation or perhaps an international one?

[Shortcuts: A New Vision for Siri and iOS Automation - MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/stories/shortcuts-a-new-vision-for-siri-and-ios-automation/?cmdid=W57UV1QZPB20WG)
- <mark>Here’s why I believe Apple and the Workflow (now Shortcuts) team have been incredibly smart in reframing the concept of user automation around Siri and voice: when you think about it, custom phrases aren’t too dissimilar from keyboard shortcuts. However, spoken phrases are easier to remember – they don’t feel like dark magic to regular users who have never bothered with “automation” before, and, most of all, they are natively supported across the entire spectrum of Apple products, from iPhones and AirPods to HomePods and Watches.3</mark>

…”dark magic????”

- <mark>New print menu. Whether you still print paper documents or, like most people these days, just want to generate PDFs, iOS 15 has a great addition in store for you: a completely redesigned Print menu. Available in Safari and other apps that can print content, the new 'Print Options' screen lets you choose paper size (including popular options such as A3 and A4) as well as the orientation of your document between portrait and landscape without having to physically rotate your device. As before, you can pinch-open the document preview in the Print screen to view the PDF version of it and export it to Files or other apps, which makes this revamped Print functionality a fantastic way to create PDF documents from Safari.</mark>
