associate with my job I know so I want to be sorry I thought that might be a good example I guess I've just come to realize sort of the old ones but over the past year that for whatever reason I guess maybe I just spend so much spent so much time fucking around and I was here from the beginning when there was no illusion about social media being it like we were all just screwing around meeting people you know making stupid jokes playing stupid pranks And I was there during that time and I've been here and all I can say is hopefully this is the first I'm hearing this from a baby but like I never experience any of the negative things that I hear and have heard recently more more about other people experiencing on social media Never really come across anything I don't wanna see it now there's a big problem that of course say this is it is hard for me to do a pitch kiss I'd rather just tell you I don't give a fuck it's hard for me to withhold knowledge because I feel like I have so little that out of actually is but anyway the thing is OK I've got the skills in my own life I know oh and haven't been through appeared on my side in my life were like I legitimately felt uncomfortable with my dependence on that basic notification gratification OK And I went through it like I know I worked through that I guess yeah fuck I'm gonna I am gonna be self deprecating about it

personal automation free services wife asked to just keep a third-party very nice to go back and look through through the scrapbook of other the stuff that you like fire funny sorry I really do I wanted to explain because like and now maybe I can come back at the point I was trying to make is like I've see so much I see some other conferences and fucking books out the ass on how to do SCO digital marketing OK you people there do that Who are you absolutely depended upon more than any of the both both in the educators and people and they're in educated in and outside who do you need a towel number are you in fact in order for that to be a legitimate business at all you need users sewers and like so I guess I've watched that business instead of just I guess it really has made Twitter and an under made it a place that makes people feel icky well I don't know if I could really charge for it I I think I'm gonna do this this is a fish I would do it like I've been trying to figure out how to find a way to get people to ask me to help them and I'm a real or you know they remembered Something that is it is a story that I was basically like someone told me once that literally like a big problem for free like for nonprofits OK is now it's a city basically offering something for free for whatever reason for all especially as Americans people just don't let certain people don't respond to it you will find putting a price on it even if it's it like exhort not a huge don't wanna be like one that indicates that's that's for whatever reason well at this point that is your ultimate expression of confidence and the quality of work is pretty high priced so maybe I'll put like a high price on it to get people to come in And then but just decide not to charge them
